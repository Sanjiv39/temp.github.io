{        position : static //default}
flows with the page

{        position : relative}
flows with the page, but can be positioned using top, bottom, left and right relative to the html page. 
other elements won't be fitting for its gap.

{        position : absolute}
flows relative to the nearest ancestor having position other then static. if all are static it uses the 
document as relative to. gap is filled by other elements.

{        position : fixed}
flows relative to the viewport and is fixed there. it doesn't moves even if page is scrolled. does not leaves
gap to its normal position.

{        position : sticky}
flows relative to scroll position. it acts as relative until the positional parameters are met then becomes 
fixed. here too the gap is not filled by others
